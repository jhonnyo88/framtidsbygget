# Component Development Sequence

**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Optimal build order för maximum AI development success  
**Focus:** Risk-minimized progression with clear quality gates

---

## Development Philosophy

### Success-Driven Sequencing
1. **Build confidence early** - Start with high-success components
2. **Establish patterns** - Create reusable implementations
3. **Validate architecture** - Test integrations incrementally
4. **Handle complexity last** - Save hardest challenges for when expertise is built

### Quality Gate Strategy
- **Each phase must complete** before moving to next
- **All tests must pass** before progression
- **Performance targets must be met** at each stage
- **No broken builds** carried forward

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Component Handling

#### ConnectivityGameModule (5/10 Success Rate)
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Prototype early** - Build simplified version first
2. **Incremental complexity** - Add features one by one
3. **Extensive testing** - Test each integration point
4. **Performance monitoring** - Watch for frame rate drops
5. **Fallback plans** - Simplified version if needed

#### PixiJS Integration Challenges
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Pattern establishment** - Prove patterns with PuzzleGame first
2. **Memory management** - Implement proper cleanup from start
3. **State bridge testing** - Validate React-PixiJS communication early
4. **Performance baselines** - Establish targets and monitor continuously

#### Complex State Management
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Context patterns** - Establish reliable patterns early
2. **State validation** - Add runtime checks for state consistency
3. **Debug tooling** - Implement state inspection tools
4. **Backup systems** - Local storage fallbacks for critical data

### Blocked Development Recovery

#### If High-Risk Component Fails
1. **Fallback implementation** - Simplified version maintaining functionality
2. **Feature reduction** - Remove non-essential features temporarily
3. **Alternative approaches** - Different technical implementation
4. **Timeline adjustment** - Extend development phase if needed

#### Quality Gate Failures
1. **Root cause analysis** - Identify specific failure points
2. **Targeted fixes** - Address issues systematically
3. **Additional testing** - Comprehensive validation of fixes
4. **Documentation updates** - Record lessons learned
