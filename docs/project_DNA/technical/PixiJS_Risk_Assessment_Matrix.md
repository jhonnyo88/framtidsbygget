## Risk Scoring Methodology

### Severity Levels
- **Critical (4)**: Complete feature failure, data loss, or security breach
- **High (3)**: Major functionality impairment affecting multiple users
- **Medium (2)**: Noticeable issues affecting user experience
- **Low (1)**: Minor inconveniences with minimal impact

### Probability Levels
- **High (3)**: Very likely to occur (>70% chance)
- **Medium (2)**: Moderately likely to occur (30-70% chance)
- **Low (1)**: Unlikely to occur (<30% chance)

### Risk Score Calculation
**Risk Score = Severity Ã— Probability** (Range: 1-12)
- **Critical Risk**: 9-12
- **High Risk**: 6-8
- **Medium Risk**: 3-5
- **Low Risk**: 1-2

## AI Developer Risk Factors

### Common AI Implementation Pitfalls

1. **Render Loop Mismanagement**
   - **Risk**: Creating multiple animation loops instead of using shared ticker
   - **Impact**: Exponential performance degradation
   - **Prevention**: Enforce single ticker pattern, provide ticker management utilities

2. **Resource Loading Anti-patterns**
   - **Risk**: Loading assets inside render loops or without caching
   - **Impact**: Network flooding, memory bloat
   - **Prevention**: Mandatory asset preloading phase, resource manifest system

3. **Event Handler Accumulation**
   - **Risk**: Adding listeners without cleanup, especially in React effects
   - **Impact**: Memory leaks, duplicate event firing
   - **Prevention**: Strict useEffect patterns, automated cleanup verification

4. **State Update Cascades**
   - **Risk**: Triggering React re-renders from PixiJS update loops
   - **Impact**: Performance death spiral
   - **Prevention**: Batched updates, RAF-based state sync

5. **Context Misunderstanding**
   - **Risk**: Confusing React context with PixiJS display context
   - **Impact**: Broken references, initialization failures
   - **Prevention**: Clear naming conventions, type safety

### AI-Safe Implementation Guidelines

```typescript
// MANDATORY PATTERN for AI implementations
interface PixiComponentProps {
  // All PixiJS components MUST follow this structure
  containerRef: React.RefObject<HTMLDivElement>;
  gameState: GameState;
  onStateChange: (newState: Partial<GameState>) => void;
  options?: PixiApplicationOptions;
}

// ENFORCE: Single app instance per component
// ENFORCE: Cleanup on unmount
// ENFORCE: State sync through props only
// ENFORCE: No direct DOM manipulation
```

## Risk Response Strategies

### Immediate Response Procedures

1. **Performance Crisis** (FPS < 20)
   - Enable performance mode
   - Disable non-essential effects
   - Reduce particle counts
   - Switch to static backgrounds

2. **Memory Crisis** (>300MB usage)
   - Force garbage collection
   - Unload unused scenes
   - Clear texture cache
   - Reset to checkpoint

3. **Sync Failure** (Multiplayer desync)
   - Pause game for all players
   - Request state reconciliation
   - Rollback to last known good state
   - Log incident for analysis

4. **Accessibility Failure**
   - Activate fallback UI
   - Enable high contrast mode
   - Provide text alternatives
   - Log accessibility context
