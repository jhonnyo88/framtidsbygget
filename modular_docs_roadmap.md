# Modular Documentation Rollout Roadmap

**Project:** Framtidsbygget Documentation Modularization  
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks  
**Start Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Goal:** Convert all documentation to AI-optimized modular packages

---

## üìä Executive Summary

Transform existing monolithic documentation (~150k+ tokens) into modular packages optimized for AI development. Target: 15-20 packages, each under 30k tokens, with clear dependencies and self-contained functionality.

**Key Benefits:**
- 80% reduction in AI context usage
- Faster development cycles
- Improved documentation quality
- Better team onboarding
